**Tacos** are one of the most commonly known Mexican street food dish in America. An average taco *usually* consist of a soft shell tortilla loaded with a variety of fillings. People typically eat this dish with their bare hands and enjoy it with a glass of coke for a rice drink called [horchata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horchata).
